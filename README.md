### üñºÔ∏è Image Processing Service

Welcome to the backend powerhouse that chews on images, digests them,
and spits out exactly what you asked for --- resized, rotated, filtered,
or just safely tucked into a database.

### üöÄ Running the Project

The whole thing is dockerized, so you don't have to summon any local
dependency demons. By default, it runs with Docker Compose.
To run it in docker, first simply comment line with spring.profiles.active=local in application.properties and uncomment spring.profiles.active=docker

Spin it up from the project directory with:

``` bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml   -p imageprocessingservice up -d --build
```

I've also set up an IntelliJ IDEA debug configuration for convenience, where only DB is dockerized:\

For faster builds, this project uses **BuildKit** magic:\
https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/

There's also a handy init script at `db/init/init.sql` which sets up the
database and seeds it with some starting data.\
*(In the next version, this whole init process will be automated ---)*
